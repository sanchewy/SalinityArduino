# Salinity Arduino Desalination Project 

This project for EGEN 310 had interdisciplinary teams of 4 create a portable desalination device. The code in this project ran an arduino which collected data from a salinity probe and a pressure sensor. The data was written to a serial connection and collected on the other end by Processing script which wrote to a csv. Finally, this csv was opend in excel for graphing and visualization.
